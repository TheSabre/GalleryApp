Android SDK:

Android SDK(software development kit) consists of various packages necessary for developing the application.
Some examples of the packages are API packages, Google USB driver(required for the running the application on our own device),
HAXM installer(for accelerating the launch of virtual device) etc.
//////////////////////////
ADT:

ADT(Android Developers tools) is a plugin available for Eclipse IDE. This plugin is vital to use SDK.
//////////////////////////
Android Manifest:

Android Manifest is an xml file while contains all the information about the application. This information includes
the minimum API, target API, the icon for the application, the theme of the application. The manifest file can be
used to set the launcher activity. Every activity to be used in the application must be declared in the Android
manifest file else it throws a runtime error.
//////////////////////////
Android Emulator:

Android Emulator or AVD is a virtual device which is primarily used to test the application. The application can be
tested across various devices to check the functionality and also the UI. It is important to check the application with 
multiple devices with different size and computing power. If the application is designed for just one screen size the 
size of the UI(buttons, textView etc) would look different on every device. Also if the application does some heavy computing 
and targets many small devices, it is critical to check if the application works well on those devices and optimize
the application accordingly. If the application is lagging it would throw a warning saying "application skipping frames. 
The application is doing too much work on its main thread". 
//////////////////////////
DDMS:

DDMS(Dalvik Debug Monitor Server) is a tools primarily used for debugging purposes. For example, in this assignment I used
DDMS to pull the database file generated in the AVD by the application to check if the tables are created and
the values are inserted or not. However, it can also monitor the threads running in the application, heaps, network statistics
and much more.
//////////////////////////
Purpose of MainActivity.java:

MainActivity.java is the default name given to the launcher activity or the first activity that is created.
MainActivity.java can be considered as the brain of the activity, meaning it contains all the logic required to do the 
work. For example, in this assignment we were required to set some restrictions/constraints on the edit text field.
This required some logic, and thus it uses java. Also, we had to retrieve and send the information to the database, which
again requires some computing. All this work needs to be done in MainActivity.java. It is important to note that, every
activity named MainActivity.java need not be the launcher activity. As mentioned earlier, it is decided by the Android
Manifest file.
//////////////////////////
Purpose of main_activity.xml

main_activity.xml is the design layout of the MainActivity.java provided main_activity.xml is the parameter given to
setContentView() method in onCreate() method of MainActivity.java. main_activity.xml contains the UI of the activity.
It is used to create buttons, EditText, TextView, CheckBox etc. The background of the application, color of the buttons,
background of EditText etc can be modified using main_activity.xml.
